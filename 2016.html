        <h1>2016 to Present - The Modern Era of Trickshoting</h1>
        <h2>Ever since FaZe Clan transitioned away from trickshoting and more into lifestyle videos they have acquired more fame and money than anyone ever could've predicted, there has been a steady decline in popularity in the trickshoting community though. Trickshoting is as small as it's been in 7 years and we're all anxiously waiting for that game that perhaps will spark our interest into another trickshoting era. Until that day, we can reminisce on all of the amazing trickshots and montage videos as relics of the past.</h2>
