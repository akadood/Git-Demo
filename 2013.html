      <h1>2013 - Black Ops 2 Take Over</h1>\
      <h2>In 2013 there was a divide in the community, the people who went back to Modern Warfare 2 and the people who stuck with Black Ops 2. Most of these people stayed on BO2 and found the mechanic called the instaswap. Like the glide and over the shoulder from Modern Warfare 2, instaswapping was a mechanic in BO2 that allowed the player to be more creative with their trickshots. I feel like this was the pivotal moment that kick started the Black Ops 2 era. Throughout 2013 trickshoters pushed trickshoting in Black Ops 2 further than we thought could be possible. The physics engine of the game was very friendly to trickshoters and help progress the community even further in terms of technical abilities. Meanwhile on the more social YouTube side, teams like FaZe, Soar and Obey continued to grow at a rapid rate, beyond that, individual members within FaZe Clan began to create content that went further than trIckshoting videos, they created live commentaries and real life videos to show off their personalities behind the screen. Players such as FaZe Apex and FaZe Rain quickly approached 1 million subscribers on their personal YouTube channels and many members of the trickshoting community were becoming staples in the YouTube gaming community.</h2>

<h1>2014 - More of the Same</h1>
<h2>In 2014 there was a new breed of trickshoters, a lot of the Modern Warfare 2 trickshoters had quit and Black Ops 2 had advanced to the point where every trickshot that could be hit, was being hit. This year balanced high technical standards with hitting trickshots consistently. Meanwhile on the YouTube side, many of the FaZe Clan members had reached 1 million subscribers. The FaZe Clan Official YouTube channel reached 3 million subscribers. Black Ops 2 although no longer fresh, was still viable and fun and trickshoters continued to play and enjoy the game with massive growth coming from the fans.</h2>

<h1>2015 - The Beginning of the End</h1>
<h2>2015 was the 3rd year on Black Ops 2 and the 6th of Modern Warfare 2. Although some people were still trickshoting on other games like Call of Duty MW3 and Call of Duty Ghosts, there were no great games being released.This made trickshoting pretty stale so teams like FaZe used their platform for lifestyle videos and a small amount of trickshoting videos compared to 2014. This created a divide, the hardcore trickshoting fans and the fans of the individual FaZe members. When the community split during 2015, this instantly made trickshoting take a dip in viewership and popularity, a lot of the older pioneers who hadn't started making lifestyle content began to quit the scene all together. Trickshoting was still big, but on the decline.</h2>
