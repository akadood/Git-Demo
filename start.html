      <h1>What is a trickshot?</h1>
      <p>In 2010 Call of Duty was solidifying itself as a staple in the gaming industry after it's 2 prior titles COD 4 Modern Warfare and COD World at War titles were very successful. Now that community was growing at a rapid rate, it left the door open for new communities to enter the space. The Trickshoting community was one of those. Now before we continue, what even is a trickshot? Essentially an unnecessary way to take down the enemy using a sniper rifle for the sake of style. Although this did not help people complete the objective of the game, this gave many players an escape from the repetitive nature of Call of Duty and a way to grow as a player in a different, more creative way.</p>

    <h1>2010</h1>
    <h2>So on YouTube the first trickshoting pioneers began to emerge, demonstrating their style in simple (by today's standards) way. However it was fresh, so people gravitated right away. Pioneers like Zerkaa and zzirgrizz began to lay down the framework to this new era. Using no scope to get sniper kills and doing a 360 while jumping off platforms to get sniper kills. In November of 2010 Zerkaa's "Final Killcam" Episode 100 reached 1,000,000 views, marking the first occasion a trickshoting video acquired over a million views.</h2>
    <h1>2011</h1>
    <h2>2011 was the year of progress. The disparity between the trickshots from the beginning of the year and the end of the year was massive. This was also the year trickshoting teams emerged. The team at the top of the food chain? FaZe Clan. Nearing the end of 2010, doing a simple 360 spin was becoming more and more repetitive. Players wanted to be more creative with their trickshots. The technical era had began. Pulling out grenades and putting them back, throwing knives, switching weapons, all while spinning in the air. Trickshoting was becoming more and more difficult but also more and more fresh. This challenge began to build standards for the community. Targets and goals for players to join better trickshoting teams and become a YouTube sensation among the community. Throughout the entire year, new types of trickshots used much further into the future were found and utilized for the first time, such as the glide, over the shoulder and tac knife flip. By the end of the year, FaZe Clan had already reached 500,000 subscribers on YouTube and over 8 million total video views on their popular Trickshoting series "illcams".</h2>
